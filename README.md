# Flight Price Prediction: EDA and Feature Engineering

In Data Analysis What All Things We Have Done
- Finding Missing Values
- Exploring About the Numerical Variables
- Exploring About categorical Variables
- Finding Relationship between features

## Overview
This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering for a flight price prediction project. The goal of this project is to analyze the given dataset, understand the patterns, relationships, and distributions of features, and then perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive modeling of flight prices.

## EDA Highlights
- Distribution of flight prices.
- Analysis of flight durations and their impact on prices.
- Examination of the correlation between the number of stops and ticket prices.
- Exploration of relationships between airlines and prices.

## Feature Engineering
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Creating new features based on existing ones.
- Scaling and transforming features as needed for machine learning models.

## Results
The notebook presents insights gained from the EDA process and details the steps taken in feature engineering. The outcomes are crucial for building accurate and robust flight price prediction models
